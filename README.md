1. INTRODUCTION
 Video anomaly detection is a crucial application in computer vision, with
 use cases ranging from surveillance systems to robotics. This project
 i mplements an approach for detecting anomalies in video sequences using
 a Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder. By reconstructing input video sequences
 and analyzing reconstruction errors, the model identifies patterns that
 deviate from expected behavior.
 2. SPATIO-TEMPORAL AUTOENCODERS
 2.1 CONCEPT OVERVIEW
 1.
 A spatio-temporal autoencoder is a neural network architecture designed
 to learn compact representations of spatio-temporal data, such as videos.
 It comprises two main components:
 Encoder: Compresses high-dimensional input data (video sequences)
 i nto a lower-dimensional latent space.
 2.
 Decoder: Reconstructs the original input from the compressed latent
 representation.
 This reconstruction is learned by minimizing the difference between the
 i nput and the reconstructed output. The architecture is particularly suited
 for detecting anomalies in videos because:
 Normal patterns (e.g., pedestrian motion) are reconstructed accurately.
 Abnormal patterns (e.g., sudden accidents) result in higher
 reconstruction errors.
 2.2 PROJECT WORKING
 Input Representation:
 The model processes sequences of video frames (spatio-temporal data)
 as input.
 Each sequence consists of 10 consecutive frames resized to a fixed
 resolution (e.g., 64x64).
 Encoder:
 3D Convolutions: Capture spatial and temporal features simultaneously.
 Layer-wise downsampling reduces spatial resolution while extracting
 hierarchical features.
 Latent Space:
 The encoder outputs a compact latent representation that encodes the
 most critical information from the video sequence.
 Decoder:
 3D Transposed Convolutions: Gradually reconstruct the original input
 from the latent space.
 The reconstruction mimics the normal input sequence.
 Reconstruction Error:
 Reconstruction quality is quantified using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
 
Higher errors indicate potential anomalies.
